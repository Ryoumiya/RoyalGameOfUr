# RoyalGameOfUr
 A really not great implementation of The Royal Game of Ur in C++ SFML, with a lot of bad practices. or what i like to call, _Please dont copy this and learn from its many mistake_

A simple game of The royal game of Ur that i coded during my 1st year at uni for a class. _Looking back there is a lot to be desired_
